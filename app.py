                **📸 Image Quality Tips:**
                - Use good lighting (natural light preferred)
                - Capture the entire leaf if possible
                - Avoid blurry or out-of-focus images
                - Include symptoms clearly in the frame
                - Use a plain background when possible
                
                **🎯 Best Practices:**
                - Take multiple photos from different angles
                - Capture both affected and healthy parts
                - Ensure the disease symptoms are clearly visible
                - Use high-resolution images when possible
                - File size should be under 10MB
